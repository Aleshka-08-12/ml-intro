There are several types of correlation coefficients, but the most popular is Pearson’s.

For example, shoe sizes go up in (almost) perfect correlation with foot length.\n - A correlation coefficient of -1 means that for every positive increase in one variable, there is a negative decrease of a fixed proportion in the other. For example, the amount of gas in a tank decreases in (almost) perfect correlation with speed.\n - Zero means that for every increase of one variable we do not expect always increase or decrease of another variable. It is not a proof, that variables are not related with each other. That only means NO LINEAR relationship between them. Suppose we have variables x and y connected by a sinusoidal law $y=sin(x)$. There is obvious no linear relationship between them (for $x \\in [0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}]$ y increases unevenly ant later for $x \\in [\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\pi]$ y decreases unevenly).
